## Challenges Faced & Solutions 🛠️

### Challenge 1: Smooth Parallax Animation

- **Issue:** Creating natural card scaling and movement on horizontal scroll was tricky.  
- **Solution:** Used `PageController.page` to track scroll position and scale cards; added subtle image movement inside cards for layered parallax.

### Challenge 2: Consistent Quantity Control

- **Issue:** Multiple quantity controls caused inconsistent UI and complex state handling.  
- **Solution:** Built a reusable `QuantitySelector` widget used across Product Detail and Cart screens, simplifying state management and UX.
